🛍️ eShop Project - Hands-on REST Learning 🚀

Welcome to my eShop project, where I've put my REST learning into action! This repository showcases a fully functional e-commerce platform that I've developed to enhance my understanding of RESTful APIs.

🌟 Key Features:
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints for product listing, order management, user authentication, and more.
- Leveraged best practices for API design, including proper HTTP methods and status codes.
- Utilized JSON data format for seamless communication between the client and server.
- Integrated essential security measures such as input validation and authentication tokens.

📚 What I've Learned:
Through this project, I've deepened my knowledge in several areas:
- Designing RESTful APIs that follow industry standards and principles.
- Handling various HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources.
- Managing user sessions and authentication to ensure secure interactions.
- Building dynamic and interactive user interfaces to enhance the shopping experience.
- Gaining practical insights into project structuring, version control, and collaboration on GitHub.

🔧 Technologies Used:
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- API Tool : Postman

🚀 How to Run:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/vivek-tripathi-9005/eShop`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd eShop`
3. Run `npm install` command in terminal to install required dependencies.
4. Create an .env file or run `touch .env` for the same and create 3 variables in it
    1. API_URL : <!-- Contains version of api like api/v1 -->
    2. secret: <!-- Contains a word for authentication encryption -->
    3. CONNECTION_STRING : <!-- Contains url of mongodb database for example for local host(mongodb://localhost:27017/) -->
5. Run `node app.js` to start server and make sure that database connection is active to avoid errors.

Feel free to explore the codebase and documentation to understand how I tackled different challenges and implemented REST principles in a real-world application. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or collaborations to further improve this project and my skills. Let's connect and learn together! 🤝

Happy coding! 🚀👨‍💻
